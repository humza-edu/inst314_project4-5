We create immense pressure on ourselves to be a reflection of these unattainable images and media that we consume but when more often than not we fall short, we spiral into bouts of depression and anxiety. 

Second leading cause: worldly unrest (wars) - the world has always been in some state of unrest. Wars go back to the Earths very first days of existence. While it is good to be informed of the worlds news and politics it is a cause of mental distress as we fear for the state of the world and what it will all amount to in light of the violence.

I think social media results in the user making inevitable comparisons to others. This can  cause feelings of inadequacy and parents (consciously or subconsciously) pressuring their children to conform to a certain version of success that may result in anxiety for the child. I also think social media prevents both parents and children from bonding and interacting together in-person. This can cause families to feel a lack of connection and support. 

Second-leading cause: lack of support and resources to handle the rise in mental heath issues

Schools, colleges, and even workplaces need to offer support or resources for those struggling. Having destressing events, mediation, talks about mental health etc... can make it easier for those experiencing mental illness symptoms to recognize them and treat it before it spirals out of hand.
